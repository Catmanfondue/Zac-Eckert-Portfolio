							<p className=''>
								Hello! My name is Zac and I am a Software Engineer who currently
								works out of Salt Lake City. I love learning the latest tech and
								growing along side the ever-evolving tech industry.
							</p>

							<p className='mt-4 '>
								I am originally from Green Bay, Wisconsin and have been
								programming since highschool. I graduated college with a degree
								in software development. Following graduation, I worked for 3
								years at a company in Green Bay. Later, I moved to a Salt Lake
								City to join a more competitive and advanced tech culture.
							</p>

						<motion.div variants={fadeInUp} className='mt-12'>
							<h2 className='text-xl underline lg:text-3xl'>Outside of Tech</h2>

							<p className=''>
								My hobbies include hiking, playing basketball, and recently,
								bouldering! Although it is clear that I am a beginner compared
								to other climbers, I find it satisfying to challenge myself with
								a new activity.
							</p>

							<p className='mt-4 '>
								When I&apos;m not outdoors or doing something active, you can
								find me spending time with my girlfriend my dog. I also enjoy
								playing video games, going to local breweries and cheering on my
								favorite sports teams: Green Bay Packers and Milwaukee Bucks.
