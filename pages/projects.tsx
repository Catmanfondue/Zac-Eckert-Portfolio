							I was once at a party where one person was connected to the
							speakers that was playing the music. Several people were pestering
							the person in control of the music to have them play to their song
							right at that moment. They said to me after: <br />{' '}
							<span style={{}}>
								&quot;I wish there was a way they could just vote on what song
								to play and not have to bother me.&quot;
							</span>
						</motion.p>

						<motion.p variants={fadeInUp}>
							Even though there was probably already an existing app to do this,
							I wanted to prove to myself that I could do it. Hence,
							TuneRoomz.com was born. I created a full stack, real time, web
							application that works with your spotify.
